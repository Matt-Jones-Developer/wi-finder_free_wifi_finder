          <h3>Wi-Finder - Terms of Use</h3>
          <h5 className={`${styles.highlight}`}>March 20, 2023</h5>
          <p>These terms of use (“Terms”) apply to persons anywhere in the world (each such person, a “User” or “you”) who install, access or use the mobile application (“App”) published by Wi-Finder LLC (“WiFi Map” or “we”). PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, AS THEY ARE A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND Wi-Finder.</p>
          <p>PLEASE BE ADVISED: THESE TERMS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT GOVERN HOW CLAIMS THAT YOU AND Wi-Finder HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER CAN BE BROUGHT (SEE SECTION 4 BELOW). THOSE PROVISIONS WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE YOU TO SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST Wi-Finder TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, GROUP OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.</p>
          <p>In order to install, access or use the Wi-Finder, you must be of legal age for those activities in the jurisdiction in which you are located. If you are not of legal age, you must not install, access or use the App.</p>
          <h4 className={`${styles.highlight}`}>1. Binding Agreement; Termination</h4>
          <p>Your access to or use of our Wi-Finder constitutes your binding agreement to those Terms, including the dispute resolution and arbitration provisions. If at any time you disagree with these Terms, you must refrain from installing our App, or, if you have already installed our App, refrain from accessing or using it and delete it. These Terms contain the entire agreement between you and Wi-Finder, and supersede any prior agreements or arrangements with you that relate in any way to Wi-Finder or the App.</p>
          <p>Wi-Finder reserves the right to immediately terminate these Terms and any services provided by Wi-Finder, including its publication of the App and provision of any content, information, functionality or other services through the App, at any time, either with respect to you or generally, for any reason, including your violation of these terms, or for no reason. The preamble above, this Section 1, 2-4 and Sections 6-19 shall survive the termination of these Terms.</p>
          <h4 className={`${styles.highlight}`}>2. Governing Law</h4>
          <p>These Terms, and any claims, disputes or controversies related to your use of the App or any content, information and related materials (“Content”) provided through the App or otherwise related to the relationship between you and Wi-Finder, whether contractual or non-contractual, are governed by the laws of the United Kingdom, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule, whether in the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction, that would cause the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom to apply.</p>
          <h4 className={`${styles.highlight}`} >3. Jurisdiction and Venue for Claims not Subject to Arbitration</h4>
          <p>The English courts sitting in London, London shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any claims, disputes or controversies related to these Terms, your use of the App or any Content provided through the App, or otherwise related to the relationship between you and Wi-Finder, whether contractual or non-contractual, that are not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 4.</p>
          <h4 className={`${styles.highlight}`}>4. Mandatory Binding Arbitration</h4>
          <h5 className={`${styles.highlight}`}>(a) Agreement to Arbitrate</h5>
          <p>Any claims, disputes or controversies related to these Terms, your use of the App or any Content provided through the App, or otherwise related to the relationship between you and Wi-Finder, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, regardless of when they arise and regardless of any termination of these Terms, shall be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.</p>
          <p>The arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the this agreement to arbitrate or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limits on the availability and scope of discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.</p>
          <h5 className={`${styles.highlight}`}>(b) Exceptions</h5>
          <p>Notwithstanding Section 4(a), nothing in these Terms, including this Section 4, will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (i) bring an individual action in a U.S. small claims court for a matter within the jurisdiction of that court or (ii) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator. In addition, the agreement to arbitrate in this Section 4 doesn't stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Those agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).</p>
          <h5 className={`${styles.highlight}`}>(c) No Class or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver</h5>
          <p>YOU AND Wi-Finder EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Wi-Finder agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.</p>
          <h5 className={`${styles.highlight}`}>(d) Arbitration Rules</h5>
          <p>Either you or Wi-Finder may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Wi-Finder will take place in the English language under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Section 4. The Federal Arbitration Act shall apply to, and govern the interpretation and enforcement of, this provision (despite the choice of law provision above). The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-787</p>
          <h5 className={`${styles.highlight}`}>(e) Notice; Process</h5>
          <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or if we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice”). Wi-Finder's address for Notice is: Wi-Finder LTD, Attn: Director/Boss, 12 Somewhere Street, London, UK.</p>
          <p>The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set out the specific relief sought (“Demand”). You and Wi-Finder each shall use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or WiFi Map may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Wi-Finder shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.</p>
          <h5 className={`${styles.highlight}`}>(f) Enforceability</h5>
          <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or if we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice”).</p>
          <p>Wi-Finder’s address for Notice is: Wi-Finder Ltd, Attn. Director/Boss, 12 Somewhere Street, London, UK. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set out the specific relief sought (“Demand”). You and Wi-Finder each shall use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or WiFi Map may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Wi-Finder shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.</p>
          <h5 className={`${styles.highlight}`}>Enforceability</h5>
          <p>If the agreement to arbitrate in this Section 4 is invalidated in whole or in part, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 3 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>
          <h4 className={`${styles.highlight}`}>Grant of License</h4>
          <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Wi-Finder hereby grants
            you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable,

            licensors. Neither these Terms nor your use of the App convey or
